I spend most of my time writing code in text editors[^ed] that have syntax highlighting and I prefer my snippets similarly highlighted. While there are many syntax highlighting engines and websites in existence, one of the most powerful engines happens to be [Pygments](http://pygments.org/), which is python-based, as the name implies.

[^ed]: [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) really are the *only* editors worth using.
