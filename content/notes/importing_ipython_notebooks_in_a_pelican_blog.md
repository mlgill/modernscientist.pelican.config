# Importing IPython Notebooks in a Pelican Blog

2013/06/02

These setup notes are based on an installation of the following:

* IPython, version 0.13.2
* nbcovert, GitHub commit [0fababc961cbe0b58df4cf0286e6b2c41fb695c5](https://github.com/ipython/nbconvert/commit/0fababc961cbe0b58df4cf0286e6b2c41fb695c5)
* liquid tags, GitHub [pull request](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/pull/21)

------------------

The following changes were made to files due to issues discovered in the conversion process:

* In the file `notebook.py` in the liquid tags plugin line 182, 

```python
ConverterBloggerHTML(nb_path)
```

must be changed to

```python
ConverterBloggerHTML(infile=nb_path)
```

as discovered by [Thomas Wiecki](https://mobile.twitter.com/TWiecki/status/336847153374838784). 

* Remove the following two lines (144-145),

```python
if div_start not in [len(body_lines), len(body_lines) - 1]:  
    raise ValueError("parsing error: didn't find the end of the div")
```  

in the same file because they were incorrectly raising an error.

* The stable branch of IPython does not include a file necessary to generate the CSS styles for the notebook. To remedy this, I copied the file `$PYTHONSITE/IPython/frontend/html/notebook/static/css/notebook.css`, where `$PYTHONSITE` is the location of the python site-package directory, to `style.min.css` within the same directory.

* To make the notebook portion of the posts inherit font styling from the article, the file `_nb_header.html` was copied to `_nb_header_mod.html` to prevent overwriting during pelican compilation. This file was then set as the external html file in the pelican configuration file. The following changes were made to the modified file, where the line which has been converted into a comment is the original and the second is the modified version.

At approximately line 78,  
```css
/*div.ipynb { font:13px/1.231 sans-serif; *font-size:small; }*/ /* Hack retained to preserve specificity */  
div.ipynb { font:inherit; *font-size:small; }
```
At approximately line 113,  
```css
/*div.ipynb {font: inherit; font-size: inherit; background-color: inherit; font-family: inherit;}*/
div.ipynb {margin:0;font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:20px;color:#000000;background-color:inherit;} 
```
At approximately line 978,
```css
/*div.ipynb {background-color:#ffffff;}*/
div.ipynb {background-color:inherit;}
```
And the following was inserted at approximately line 28,
```css
img.anim_icon{padding:0; border:0; -webkit-box-shadow:none; -box-shadow:none}
```
all of which were borrowed from the CSS file of Jake Vanderplas' [blog](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonicPerambulations/blob/master/_nb_header_mod.html).
