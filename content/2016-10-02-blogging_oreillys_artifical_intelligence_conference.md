Last Monday and Tuesday, I attended O'Reilly's first ever Artificial Intelligence Conference, courtesy of [Women in Machine Learning & Data Science (WiMLDS)](http://wimlds.org). I tweeted about many of the talks I saw, but here is the recap on their [blog](http://wimlds.org/michelle-gill-oreilly-artificial-intelligence-conference/).

Many thanks to WiMLDS for this opportunity. I will be attending O'Reilly AI next year!
