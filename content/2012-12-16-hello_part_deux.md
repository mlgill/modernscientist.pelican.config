After much consternation and hand wringing, I am attempting to revive my blog. I've learned from previous deterrents and now have a clearer vision of the topics I'd like to cover. So, for the time being, I am simply saying "hello" and giving those interested the opportunity to subscribe.

In the meantime, I leave you with a picture of one my[^nysbc] toys: a 900 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with a cyropbrobe. This is an example[^eg] of the instruments I use to collect data. You can learn a little more about me and how I use NMR [here](http://modernscientist.com/pages/about.html).

[^eg]: A *very* nice example.
