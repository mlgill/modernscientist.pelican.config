Title: About
Slug: about

I am a biophysicist and data scientist. Currently, I am a Data Science Fellow at Metis in New York City. 

My Ph.D. is in Molecular Biophysics & Biochemistry. I used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to study the motions of biomacromolecules called enzymes, which play important roles in normal organismal function and in the malfunction that occurs during disease states. NMR enables these motions to be studied with atomic resolution on timescales spanning fourteen orders of magnitude. I also developed NMR experiments for the quantitation of these motions.

An electronic version of my curriculum vitae is available [here](http://cv.michellelynngill.com).

Outside of work, I enjoy programming in python, all things made by Apple, running, Kansas basketball (Go Jayhawks!), my collection of cashmere sweaters, and a good mixed drink.
