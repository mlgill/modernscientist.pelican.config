Title: About
Slug: about

I am a former biophysicist currently in transition to a data scientist. Currently, I am a member of the Summer 2016 Metis Data Science Bootcamp in New York City. 

My Ph.D. is in Molecular Biophysics & Biochemistry with a focus on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. I studied the motions of biomacromolecules called enzymes, which play import roles in normal organismal function and in the malfunction that occurs during disease states. NMR enables these motions to be studied with atomic resolution on timescales spanning fourteen orders of magnitude. I also developed NMR experiments for the quantitative study of these motions.

An electronic version of my curriculum vitae is available [here](https://mlgill.github.io).

Outside of work, I enjoy many other activities: programming in python, all things Apple, running, Kansas basketball (Go Jayhawks!), my collection of cashmere sweaters, and a good mixed drink.
