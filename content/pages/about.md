Title: About
Slug: about

By day and often by night, I am a biophysicist working at a major research institution in the Washington, D.C. area. I study the motions of biomacromolecules called enzymes, which play import roles in normal organismal function and in the malfunction that occurs during disease states. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, my technique of choice, these motions can be quantitated in various ways with atomic resolution.

Outside of lab, I enjoy many other activities: programming in python, all things Apple, running, Kansas basketball (Go Jayhawks!), my collection of cashmere sweaters, and a good mixed drink.
